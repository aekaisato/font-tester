# Multi Font Tester â€” MiFT

This project was created because I wanted to quickly test a bunch of fonts I had just downloaded with the same text. Since I couldn't find anything I liked on the first page of Google, I decided to make this myself. That's about it. The screenshot button "works", meaning that it saves a file, but kerning gets really screwed up, so I recommend taking a screenshot manually. The acronym is a reference to "Monsters At Work", and it doesn't need justification.
